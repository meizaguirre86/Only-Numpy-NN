This repository contains a simple neural network implemented in Python using NumPy (without TensorFlow, PyTorch or whatever ease the creation of the model) for the classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using gradient descent and utilizes ReLU activation for hidden layers and softmax for output.

Project Structure:
mnist_train.csv: The MNIST dataset for training (should be placed in the same directory).
MNIST_NeuralNet.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the model code and experiments.
